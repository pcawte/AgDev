# AgDev - compile instructions

A script ```compile.sh``` can be used to compile this source tree.
It is a Linux only compile script. 

You should clone the repo or extract the release, then just run the bash script `compile.sh`
As part of the script it will download https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain/releases/latest/download/CEdev-Linux.tar.gz

After the code is compiled, move the CEdev directory to wherever you desire and add the CEdev/bin directory to your path.
